# mask-detection
Mask detection project

This project first detects the face then predicts whether the person has mask on his face or not .If persons in front of camera are wearing mask the green box will be create around their face and with prediction "mask" and its accuracy and if there is no mask the predictions will be "no-mask" and with red box around their face. For these I have used Python,OpenCV,Mobilnet,Tensorflow
The main file is detect_from_mask_video.ipynb that you have to run in that file it uses "face detector" file and for mask detection "mask_detection" file.
